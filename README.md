# The Essence Compass - Frontend

The Essence Compass is a web application that serves as a personalized guide for individuals on their journey of self-discovery and transformation. It helps users navigate their inner world and connect with their authentic soul essence by providing a daily, interactive check-in. The app's core features include a daily 'Compass' that recommends micro-practices based on the user's current state, a visual 'Soul Essence Map' to track their personal growth, and a private 'Digital Rose Circle' for self-love and community support. The app is a dynamic, high-value tool designed to turn abstract spiritual concepts into a tangible, daily practice, helping users move from temporary fixes to permanent, authentic transformation.
